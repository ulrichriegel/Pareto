Description: Utilities for the Pareto, piecewise Pareto and generalized Pareto distribution
    that are useful for reinsurance pricing. In particular, the package provides
    a non-trivial algorithm that can be used to match the expected losses of a 
    tower of reinsurance layers with a layer-independent collective risk model.
    The theoretical background of the matching algorithm and most other methods
    are described in Ulrich Riegel (2018) <doi:10.1007/s13385-018-0177-3>.
